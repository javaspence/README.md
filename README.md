### Hello. My name is Spencer, better known as javaspence. I am a programmer and independant developer currently working on updates and more things for my flagship game, Banana Bonanza. I am also making plans for other games, including an idle game called Couch Potato Simulator. Follow me to stay updated since all of my projects are open source.
